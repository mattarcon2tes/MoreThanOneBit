# MoreThanOneBit

The present repository contains an Excel file with the inequalities required to certify more than one random bit from one entangled bit, distributed among two boxes A and B. The file assesses both the device-independent case ---where the two boxes are uncharacterized--- and the semi-device-independent case where only the box A is uncharacterized. The inequalities are coeffficients of the form F(ab|xy) acting linearly on the distribution P(ab|xy). For completeness we also provide the  distribution obtained from the experimental frequencies, and a brief description of the measurement settings used.
