# MoreThanOneBit

The present repository contains an Excel file with the inequalities required to certify more than one random bit from one entangled bit, distributed among two boxes A and B. The file assesses both the device-independent case, where the two boxes are uncharacterized, and the semi-device-independent case where only the box A is uncharacterized.
