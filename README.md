# MoreThanOneBit

The present repository contains an Excel file with the inequalities required to certify more than one random bit from one entangled bit, distributed among two boxes A and B. The file assesses both the device-independent case ---where the two boxes are uncharacterized--- and the semi-device-independent case where only the box A is uncharacterized. The inequalities are coeffficients of the form F(ab|xy) acting linearly on the distribution P(ab|xy): the sum over a, b, x and y of F(ab|xy)P(ab|xy) provides the guessing probability Pguess, from which -log2(Pguess) random bits are certified from P(ab|xy) and the inequality F. In particular, if this sum is equal to (or greater than) 1, no randomness is certified.  For completeness we also provide the distribution obtained from the experimental frequencies, and a brief description of the measurement settings used.
